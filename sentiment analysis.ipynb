I am not able to agree with the build left behind after once use, but did not experience that so far. I did not love the smell, but I liked it better after smelling it on my hair. I have thick semi-long hair, and I felt it did as good a job at cleaning it as any other comparable shampoo for this price range (like Pantene). I did not think it was the best shampoo I have ever used, but it was as good as I have bought at the grocery store in awhile. Pretty decent shampoo that cleanses well and feels good in the hand and on the scalp, though I would balk at paying almost five dollars for this in the store or on Amazon.',\n",
       " 'Almost Too Easy! This packet makes excellent pulled pork. It calls for a 3lb boneless pork shoulder roast with most/all of the fat trimmed off, 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar and 1/3 cup cider vinegar. Mix up the sauce, place your pork roast in your crockpot, pour sauce over, cover and that\\'s it! You can cook your pork on high for 4 hours or low for 8 hours.<br /><br />If I\\'m going to be gone slightly longer than 8 hours then I take the pork roast out of the freezer the night before and the next morning put it in the crock only partially defrosted. This seems to help keep the pork more moist if its going to be cooking more than 8 hours on low. Because usually if I\\'m gone for work, I\\'m going to be gone at least 9 hours and sometimes as much as 10. If you\\'re going to be cooking the 4 hours on high or 8 hours on low then I recommend that the roast be completely defrosted because you want it to cook thoroughly enough that it\\'s \"pull apart\" done.<br /><br />I make this exactly as the recipe says except instead of regular brown sugar I used Splenda blend. I thought the ratio between meat and bbq was perfect using two pounds of meat rather than three. If you use 3lbs and you like your bbq pretty \"saucey\", I\\'d add a couple of tablespoons of water to the mix to make it stretch a bit further.<br /><br />If you decide to cook this on high, I recommend using 1-2 tablespoons of water to keep the bbq sauce from scorching because generally I cook this on the low setting for 8 hours and once I let it go almost to 9.5 hours because I was late getting home and the sauce got kind of coagulated. That was fixed by adding just a bit of water and it was still fine but it might scorch if you are cooking on high and leave it longer than the 4 hours the recipe calls for.<br /><br />This is a great summertime meal! I serve it with cole slaw or potato salad or macaroni salad and corn on the cob. It\\'s fast and doesn\\'t heat the house up and no hovering over a hot stove.<br /><br />One last thing, I HIGHLY recommend using a crockpot liner when cooking this. I ran out the last time I cooked this and ended up having to soak my crock overnight and still had to scrub a bit to get the baked on sauce off of it.',\n",

My only concern is that the Senseo coffee pods are no longer readily available.  Most supermarkets no longer stock the packages of pods -- they allocate their shelf space to Keurig products.

But when watching a movie, I would have to say that this size would be perfect to snack on. The sweet fudge taste meets salty popcorn did for me, but I am sweet meets salty person and overall enjoyed the taste. On another note, I can add for those of you who are not chocoholics the fudge is not overpowering. I am not a true chocolate fan and in fact would rather have another type of sweet over chocolate so for me the fudge is very mellow and just the right amount. But hands down my favorite part is the fact that this just melted away in my mouth.<br /><br />As my BF tried his own bag he decided he not only wanted to try them by themselves but also as an ice cream topper! He thought it was a great ice cream topper, reminding him of a sundae with that hint of caramel and fudge.<br /><br />Eat them straight out of the bag, or get creative with them. Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn is a great portion controlled snack that is a flavor melt in your mouth.<br /><br />A little tip for others who might be watching their snack cravings: Remember to only eat 1 bag at a time.',\n",

Organic products don't act or cook like the mass produced brand but the difference is in the organic nature of these items.<br />- Our experience cooking for over 50 people and over 12 pies so far is they all tasted fine and didn't see any issues in consistency.<br /><br />3. Dented cans, 36 cans purchased and no dents.<br /><br />4. Lastly, beyond the value it was organic with a shelf life on our cans into late 2013.

I grew up in New York City, and fondly remember the jingle, \"Conta-dina...tomato...sauce....New York\\'s...best...selling...brand!\"<br /><br />This is Contadina Tomato PASTE, of course, not the sauce -- but it\\'s made by the same people, and, unlike the tomato sauce, I have actually tried the Contadina Tomato PASTE.<br /><br />Tomato paste is similar in all brands.  Look at the ingredient panel.  The ingredient (usually), is just \"tomatoes\".  The only exception are brands like \"Muir Glen\", (also sold on Amazon.com), which is Organic. (Sadly, \"Del Monte\"-a large corporation -- also sold organic tomato paste for a while, but no longer does.  Please sell it again, Del Monte -- and I, and I\\'m sure many others -- will buy it!)<br /><br />In the meantime, Contadina tomato paste is as good as any other.  In some ways, it is preferable to other brands. Why?  Well, one reason is the picture on the can.  Instead of just tomatoes, as other brands have, Contadina tomato paste features a pretty lady, and in the background, an Italian tomato grove.  It\\'s buildings seem beautiful, and somewhat mysterious, as Italian buildings sometimes are.  If one is of a creative mind-set, looking at these buildings, (and the pretty lady), could, possibly, be the start of an interesting story to write...which might even become a best-seller and featured on Amazon!<br /><br />A more practical reason why (another type of) Contadina tomato sauce might be purchased is this:  Contadina ALSO makes, (in 6 ounce cans), an \"Italian Style\" tomato paste.  Though not the item featured here, it is certainly something to look for....hopefully, in the future on Amazon, and right now, in your local supermarket or warehouse store.  \"Italian Style\" Contadina tomato paste, in addition to mainly consisting of tomatoes, ALSO has a few spices and herbs.  These (to me), expertly chosen and blended herbs, add to the flavouring, and make for a tastier dish!<br /><br />As for the plain tomato paste being reviewed here, it\\'s as good as any other brand -- plus you get that nice picture on the label.  It\\'s not organic -- but it IS all-natural.  Just tomatoes.  The 12-ounce size means you don\\'t have to open the can as often, you have plenty, (if you are preparing more than 2 servings at a time), and a 12-ounce can, because of it\\'s size, will probably last longer on the shelf than a 6-ounce can, as smaller amounts of any food will spoil faster than larger amounts.<br /><br />Tomato PASTE -any brand -- is, I think, far more economical than tomato sauce.  Tomato sauce usually includes \"water\" as an ingredient, and most people can add that themselves!  Diluted, and with different ingredients added, tomato paste can become tomato soup, tomato juice...even tomato sauce!  If you don\\'t want the bother of growing and/or canning your own tomatoes, just buying tomato PASTE at the store seems an economical, tasty, and very easy-to-prepare choice!<br /><br />\"Contadina Tomato Sauce -- New York\\'s Best-Selling Brand.\"  I haven\\'t heard that jingle in quite a while...so it might not be true any more.  Still, this is inexpensive, and quite delicious tomato paste.  Not organic...but all natural.  With that \"possibly imagination-engedering\" picture on the can, it is, I think, quite a good choice!',\n",

It seems that the built-in filter in these is bad because the grounds come out and plug the machine. I have tried many other K-Cups and these are the only ones that have ever done that.\",\n",
       " 'Chocolate Wafers in an Identity Crisis as Oreos...But If Deception Helps Monitor Calories, Why Not? I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That\\'s the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYEL1A\">A Star Is Born</a> the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That\\'s why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don\\'t get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are \"100 Calorie Packs\", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It\\'s just that I don\\'t feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack.',\n",

If you like cake and like Oreos you can't go wrong with Oreo cakesters.<br /><br />The filling will bring you back to your childhood while the cake will provide you with a whole new Oreo experience.

So, I was particularly pleased to get to try this Chan Tea product; this green tea infusion.  I'll start by warning that this looks really unappealing upon receipt and that judging from the large amount of floating debris (pulp) and the murky green color one may be almost repulsed by the presence of this product.  That said; I had to try it, so I did and I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised.  First off, this really doesn't taste anything like green tea or passion fruit, but there is a familiarity to the flavoring so maybe the subtle hints are sparking memories on my tongue.  What I will say is that the flavor is solid, with no aftertaste at all and the sweet levels are balanced to the point where this tastes fresh and authentic and organic and, well, sort of delicious.  The texture of the drink can be a little off putting, considering that there is so much pulp your constantly rolling balls off the roof of your mouth.

       " \"Try this for Sore Throat or to Wind Down!!! First of all, I am a tea drinker.  I have been drinking tea all my 60 years of life and I LOVE tea.  Stash is a wonderful tea and they have a tremendous line of delicious flavors out there right now. Stash chamomile is caffeine free.<br /><br />Now, let me share one of Kathy W's secrets with you. (S-h-h-h-h-h...) Chamomile tea is EXCELLENT for sore throats, scratchy throats, any throat irritation.  I first learned about Chamomile tea from my Greek neighbors. YaYa and PaPu always gave the grandchildren Chamomile tea whenever they got sick.  It not only is very soothing but it somehow soothes throat irritations.  Over the years, I have found that if I get a sore throat, I drink 2 cups of chamomile tea, one behind the other, and my throat STOPS hurting.  If it starts again the next day, I repeat the procedure, and it stops again.<br /><br />I rarely get sick now-a-days, and if I get a bug, it passes through and out real quick, but I have turned many a friend and co-worker on to my little secret.  It works!  Chamomile brews/steeps as a yellow tea and it has a different taste than black tea.  So, if the taste is strange to you initially, you will probably get used to it quickly.  I assure you, it beats the heck out of having a sore throat.  For a sore throat, you can also add honey if you want.  Honey makes it even more smooth and soothing.<br /><br />Some people also like a cup of chamomile tea before bedtime because it is soothing and helps them wind down.<br /><br />So, when you use this for a sore throat, and you realize it helped you or your children, do me a favor.  Look up to heaven and say Thank You to YaYa and PaPu Harjandrou for sharing this special secret with all of us.<br /><br />God Bless you all.<br /><br />(Note: I am not a doctor.)\",\n",

       " \"Bragg, good for gout I just recently discovered I have gout and searched online for some form of home treatment and kept coming across Bragg with 'The Mother'. Being desperate, I was in excruciating pain sometimes and wanted to try anything. Most people online said within a couple days they noticed improvements, but for me it was about a week before I noticed that when I flex my toes the horrible pain didn't come. I have been drinking an 8oz glass 3 times a day with 2 teaspoons of this in it. It tasted horrible and smells even worse. I use a few drops of lemons or lemon juice to make it tolerable, also, put in ice and make it very cold and then take the ice out so it's not watered down, it being very cold helped too.<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for a gout treatment I recommend this. I have yet to go to the doctor, but I will go, and I do think you need to go anyway even with this treatment. I also cut out red meat and bacon and I take alfalpha tablets 3 times a day because someone said that helped them online, but I can't tell if those are working. This totally took away the pain when I bend and flex my toes, but it did take about a week to notice results at 3 times a day. I will buy again and keep using. But you definitely need to find a way to get the stuff down but this works for me.\",\n",

Our family follows the Weight Watchers program and this is a wonderful way to have peanut butter without all the points.  Just ordered a one-pound package of both the PB2 and the PB2 with chocolate.  We make smoothies with the PB2 chocolate using frozen bananas, ice, skim milk and PB2 chocolate.  Delicious!!!  Tip for sandwiches - with the PB2 we mix 6 tablespoons of powder with 3 tablespoons of water (3 points).  When using it in the kids sandwiches, I add one teaspoon of regular peanut butter.  Makes 2-3 healthy, tasteful peanut butter sandwiches.',\n",
       " \"superb product at a superb price At my local grocery store, these cans sell for almost $3 each, so I was excited by this bargain. However, the price didn't totally decide me on buying them, as I love artichoke hearts.<br /><br />These are excellent. They're quartered, so they're much easier to use in recipes, etc. I like to chop them up even more and add them to salads, pasta sauces, pizza toppings, etc.<br /><br />They are NOT marinated, so don't expect all sorts of olive oil and vinegar tastes. These are a mite salty, so rinse them if you're not a huge salt lover (I am not one myself, so I rinse pretty diligently).<br /><br />My fave way to use them:<br />I heat up some olive oil in a skillet and add minced garlic. Once the garlic is beginning to brown slightly, I add 2 cups of chopped tomatoes, 1 cup of the chopped artichokes, some chopped black olives, and whatever Italian seasonings light my fire that day. I cook this down until the tomatoes are soft, then add the mix to some whole wheat pasta and toss. I sprinkle some fresh parmesan, and voila! Sometimes, I add chopped chicken breast to the mix. Sometimes I use chopped sweet Italian sausage. Delicious!<br /><br />Anyway, these are an incredible bargain, and you can't go wrong. Just using the artichoke hearts is enough to go through several cans.<br /><br />Enjoy!\",\n",

I'm not a foodie, but I do expect flavor from food, packaged or fresh.<br /><br />Others have commented about the contents matching the pix on the packaging. Pretty much it looked the same to me although the penne pasta and chicken are mixed well within the marinara sauce.<br /><br />Plusses:<br />>>Ease of use: slit some holes, pop in microwave for about 1 minute, 45 seconds. Take out, wait a minute or so, peel off top and eat. (Peeling it off took awhile. It seemed to have some sort of glue that stuck to the sides of the plastic container.)<br /><br />>>Flavor: The marina sauce was tasty and quite a bit better than some of the bottled marinara sauce I've had. Chicken tasted like chicken and penne pasta was firm (but not break your tooth firm) and not mushy, which is important to me.<br /><br />>>Nutritional Content: If the label is correct, this isn't too bad at all if you're looking for both good fiber and protein without exorbitant sugar or sodium. And with only 5% saturated fat, that's good for fresh or packaged.<br /><br />>>Great item to store at the office or a second home or anywhere else where food may not be readily available and/or you need some backup.<br /><br />This should not be viewed as a substitute for making your own pasta to order and using a homemade or other sauce, but it's not bad when you're starving and literally want to eat in three minutes.<br /><br />Cons:<br />>>Price, which varies depending on where you buy it. Amazon has good prices with subscribe and save but at the $3 and up that convenience stores that seem to stock it charge, not such a value.<br /><br />>>Availability. Not always easily found in our area. If you like this, amazon subscribe and save is probably the best way to get it fast, in quantity and at good price.<br /><br />I've looked online at the others in the compleats line. Not impressed due to very high sodium (why can't companies understand that most of us want low sodium. Really low. Folks who want more sodium will just add salt. Good spices and other flavorings can give us the taste we need.).<br /><br />I suspect that the appeal of this will depend entirely on your own tastebuds. If you're someone who regularly eats homemade pasta sauce with fresh pasta, this will be a tough substitute. But if you use bottled pasta sauce and packaged pasta, this is akin to a prepaid version of this. You can always rev it up by adding your own veggies (steamed or heated up frozen ones) with it.<br /><br />If this didn't require a microwave to heat it up, it would be a perfect item for an emergency food kit.\",\n",

       " \"Salmon heaven I used this product this past summer while fishing across Alaska for anything I could catch that was legal at the time. I learned to use smokehouse maple seasoning sparingly since it is awfully powerful if too liberally used. By default, since it was the easiest way to cook inside my camper I braised my fish fillets.  I'm just earning how to live by truck-camper.<br /><br />Braising is a method of frying and poaching, or steaming, at the same time. One simply places a bit of olive oil in a skillet, places the seasoned fish into the skillet then puts the lid on using low to moderate heat. It fries on the bottom and the steam created cooks from the top down. One can take the lid off and turn the fillets if desired while turning the heat up for a few minutes. It takes experimentation to get a result you will be happy with. No additional salt is needed. Garlic powder works in conjunction with this method as does placing diced onions a green peppers in the skillet with the fish.<br /><br />At first I used an entire fillet with the skin on. Then I migrated to cutting the fillet vertically (belly to back) and away from the skin before braising it. It gave a more consistent product and it was easier to control the cooking uniformity this way. Also one did not have to wrestle with fish skin on the plate later.<br /><br />Now, nothing else seems to come close to the appeal of this seasoning. I'm now hooked and spoiled on it - not necessarily a good thing since it denies one a host of other tastes from other seasonings. I gave some to another fishing couple and now they want to buy it.\",\n",

The squirrels could not have cared less...but it sure stank up the back yard especially as the humid summer approached the half way mark. I moved on to this industrial strength pepper. I had hope in the first days of use, but the fruit is being harvested by small furry hands before it gets anywhere near big enough for us to pick.

All this despite a daily refreshed birdbath full of cool water AND a birdfeeder (far from the garden) full of seeds...sigh.<br /><br />The lady at the garden shop said chicken wire is the only fool-proof way to keep them out.

Since I don\\'t have this style of coffee maker, I opened the pods and poured them directly into the coffee filters I normally use to make coffee.  Two packages makes a pretty tasty, full bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />My biggest concern with this product was the incredible amount of packaging for very little product.  15 small pouches of coffee, wrapped up like tea bags, each one individually packaged in a foil packet which are all placed in a fairly large box.  The box is wonderfully designed with multi-colored, foil embossed design (it would probably make a great gift for your favorite Bob Marley fan), but the amount of packaging is unbelievably excessive for, maybe, six or seven ounces of coffee.  The elaborate declarations of \"fair trade,\" \"ethical treatment of farm workers,\" \"biodiversity\" and \"sustainable cultivation\" (among other first world catchphrases) ring hollow for me.  This all may be true but it\\'s hard not to be cynical and slightly suspicious of the true motivations for the lofty rhetoric on the box.<br /><br />The company\\'s declaration of \"we believe that pure food from the earth is physically and spiritually beneficial,\" sounds absurd when compared to the amount of waste in the packaging of their product.

After my initial order confirmation, I heard nothing from the company about when my order would be shipped. I emailed them to ask about my order on January 9th and was responded to on January 12th (14 days after my order was placed) stating that one of my items was back-ordered. Their website specifically states that they do not hold orders for back-ordered items. I then called the company and told them I needed the items (with or without the backordered items) no later than January 22nd.  They ensured me that it would arrive by then.  I received an email on January 18th informing me that my order had shipped without the backordered items and I would be receiving a refund for the missing items.  However, the package did not arrive on the 22nd as promised, forcing me to purchase the items elsewhere.  I then emailed the merchant and asked for a refund of the shipping charges since they do not accept returns.  I was refused, stating that since the error was with UPS, they were not at fault (even though their website says they ship within 7 days, which they did not, and do not hold for back-ordered items, which they did).  This is unacceptable behavior from any merchant.  I should have been able to return my items for a full refund or at minimum received a refund for the shipping charges.

       " 'Definitely an effective product (for me) I seldom review products here but I am sufficiently impressed with this product that I felt it deserved a little promotion.  Normally I do not tend to lend much credence to and am skeptical of most natural supplements\\' claims, magic elixirs, and other products that I tend to lump into the classification of \"snake oil\" type products.  For me, this product lives up to nearly all of its claims.  I began taking these infrequently after a colleague at work recommended it.  I\\'m in law enforcement and now keep a stock of these in my office and in my car.  When you have to push through a really long day (or night) at work, these are wonderful to fall back on.<br />  A lot of people who have reviewed this product attribute its effect mostly or completely to its caffeine content.  No way...  That may be true for people who have a high sensitivity to caffeine, but I drink coffee like water and have a substantial resistance to the effects of caffeine as a result.  The caffeine content in one bottle of Five Hour Energy supposedly equates to one small cup of coffee.  I can tell you that its effect on me is much more substantial than the effect of a small cup of coffee and arrives with far fewer negative effects (ahem... like a trip to the restroom that often follows morning coffee..).  Within 4-5 minutes of drinking a bottle, I always feel noticeably energized, alert, mentally sharper, and physically stronger (endurance wise).  I have only felt \"overly stimulated\" on one occasion and this was early one morning after having already drank a LOT of coffee.  On that occasion, I think the caffeine in the FHE simply pushed me over the limit.  Other than this one occasion, I have never felt \"jittery\" after having taken one.  For me it is normally only really effective for 3-4 hours, not a full five hours.<br />  I have experienced Niacin \"flush\" on one occasion after having taken one, however, I also take a large dose of Niacin every morning (the only other natural supplement I take regularly) and I again think the Niacin in the FHE simply took me over the limit in combination with my daily Niacin dose.  For those of you unfamiliar with the sensation of \"Niacin flush\" it can be a little intense the first time but is completely harmless and will pass after 5-6 minutes.  Kind of a combination of an intense all over hot-flash/sunburn.  Don\\'t panic, even though the sensation can be somewhat intense, and it will pass quickly if you happen to experience one from the Niacin in an FHE dose.<br />  Since there is a bit of a history of low B-12 levels in my family, I have always suspected FHE\\'s rather large B-12 content may be one reason it works so well for me.  I have no objective evidence that this is the case, however, I know the minimal caffeine content present would simply not have much effect on me.  All in all, I love this product, see no risky or questionable ingredients in it that concern me, and find it a very nice and effective alternative to swilling down coffee to push through a long day or night.  Give it a try sometime when you are dragging.  I think you\\'ll be pleasantly pleased unless you are unusually sensitive to caffeine.',\n",

       " 'Delicious DESCRIPTION:<br />> Blue Diamond Roasted-Salted Almonds are moderately roasted with canola, safflower, or sunflower oil (but not oily or greasy), and lightly salted.  These are \"heart healthy\" oils which are actually good for you, as is the almond oil itself.  Roasted Salted Almonds are available in bags or small cans small.<br />> Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds are similar with wonderful smokey flavor.  At this time Smokehouse Almonds are available from Amazon only in 16 oz (and smaller) bags.<br />> I have not tried the \"lightly salted\" variety but I presume that they have almost no salt.<br /><br />CANS vs BAGS<br />Various types of Blue Diamond Almonds are available in bags or small cans.  The small cans (3 1/4\" in diameter by 2 3/8\" high) are very convenient and assure that the almonds stay fresh until openned, and afterward, because they don\\'t stay \"openned\" long (it is easy to eat a whole can at one setting).  Arguably the bags more environmentally friendly, but you don\\'t get much of a price break for the much cheaper packaging.  I prefer the convenience and freshness of the cans.<br /><br />EVALUATION: Excellent and flavorful.  Well roasted and crunchy.  I cannot decide which I like best: the Roasted Salted or the Smokehouse.  Although not oily, the roasting oil does effect the flavor.  Whether that\\'s a good thing or not is a matter of individual tastes.  I happen to like the roasted-in-oil flavor.<br /><br />LESS ROASTED ALMONDS<br />If you prefer less-roasted almonds, roasted without added oil, consider <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COJ85G\">Back To Nature California Almonds, Sea Salt Roasted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />UNROASTED ALMONDS<br />Unroasted almonds are available <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COE1AI\">Back To Nature California Almonds, Unroasted & Unsalted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> but beware that thorough roasting makes almonds more digestable.  Unroasted almonds are susceptable to fungus which can be carcinogenic.  While commercial domestic almonds sold in the US do not contain significant levels of cyanide, bitter almonds, (which have a much richer almond flavor, particular in baked goods).  Indeed natural almond extract is made from bitter almonds---artificial almond extract is safer.  Bitter almonds are sometimes illegally sold in the US and are often encountered in other countries, and do contain dangerous levels of cyanide when raw.  7-10 raw bitter almonds can kill a child.  Moreover, a child raised on raw almonds may conclude that raw peach pits (essentially a variety of almonds) are safe to eat---they are NOT.  The safest practice is NOT to eat unroasted almonds.',\n",

I decided to re-write my review in order to let you guys in on how my cat's been doing on the Waruva cat food.<br /><br />We decided to try pretty much every flavor on here because I couldn't find any really good specific reviews for anything other than one or two flavors, here's how my cats liked the following:<br /><br />Paw Lickin Chicken- This is one of the favorites with both cats, although my male cat, Puppy, has a harder time eating it unless I put it on a flat plate, he can't seem to get it all while in the bowl. However, my female cat, Akira, has NO issues with it at all.<br /><br />Grandma's Chicken Soup- An epic fail for Puppy. He hates it, and refuses to eat it. I don't know if it's because of how liquidy it is, or if there's a smell he isn't so into... but he hates it.  Akira loves it and can't get enough... not sure how helpful this is, but I can say that if your cat prefers to lick their food instead of biting at it, you probably won't have a lot of success with this one, because Puppy licks his food and Akira bites hers.<br /><br />Polynesian BBQ - my least favorite of all the waruva products. It smells really strongly of fish (yuck) and is congealed... it's like jello. I have to fork it out of the can and mash it up in order to get Puppy to eat this.<br /><br />Peking Duckin was an overall success with both cats<br /><br />The Eggs and Chicken - Puppy would not eat the peas but Akira would (although she had some diarrhea after this.. but I think the eggs may be the culprit).<br /><br />Steak Frites- was hands down the favorite for both cats. It also contains pumpkin so I prefer to give it to Akira since she seems to have more issues with getting the runs.<br /><br />Those were the notable of the flavors our cats have tried.

       " \"Kitty Junk Food We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.\",\n",

I like to serve Progresso Vegetable Classics Hearty Black Bean Soup with a dollop of sour cream or a sprinkling of cheese; sometimes I add some cracked pepper and minced onion.<br /><br />However, Progresso Vegetable Classics Hearty Black Bean Soup is very difficult to find.

We had recently been using this formula until we ran out and I had to make an emergency run to the local grocery store for a quick replacement. The closest thing they had was their organic store brand. Funny thing is, when I got home to compare the two I noticed the ingredients are EXACTLY the same as well as some of the machine writing on the bottom of the cans where you can find the sell by date. From what I can gather after doing a bit of research the formula ingredients used to be different but have recently changed without letting customers know. Virtually all store brand organic formulas come from one manufacturing plant whether you buy it at store X or Y and it seems that Earth\\'s Best is now being produced in this same facility but charging a premium price.

The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth.\",\n",

       " \"Great food for a picky eater or those with digestive issues! Our Himalayan cat is an extremely picky eater.  To add to this she has intestinal trouble with many foods (diarrhea, vomiting).  We only feed her quality foods with no grains or fillers, and this narrows our selection down quite a bit, knocking out most grocery store brands.<br /><br />We initially tried Wellness and apparently it was too rich for her with all the additional unnecessary ingredients (squash, zucchini etc?)  Then we tried the Natural Balance DUCK and pea, and she hated the taste and texture, which was extremely mushy.  We then put her on this Venison flavor, and she absolutely loves it and the more meaty texture.  She is enthusiastic every time she eats.  She loves the dry as well.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this food to anyone, especially those who have a cat with a sensitive digestive system.  Not only is it a healthy grain free, artificial/dye free food, but it is also a limited ingredient food, meaning pets with food allergies or bowel problems are more likely to tolerate it.  And it's very reasonably priced!\",\n",

When I was given a bottle of this hot sauce for the first time, as far as I remember, I was just expecting a typical hot sauce--this is not typical hot sauce.  It is hotter than the other hot sauces that I like, but it is not overpowering and does not have a searing heat--more like a peppery heat.  In addition, Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce has a pleasing, exceptional flavor.  This is a hot sauce that I prefer to use only for special occasions.  It is recommendable.',\n",

Specifically, the \"One Star\" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it\\'s deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we\\'re all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of \"United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers\"....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the \"Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum\"! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a \"Potato Chip Diet\".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I\\'d like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I\\'ve taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn\\'t like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!',\n",

It's very popular with friends and family for snacking, and when the regular brand wasn't available, I purchased this one for a temporary replacement. I read through the reviews and felt this would do the trick until the regular stuff was available again.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the only thing the two seem to have in common is general shape and color. While the flavor isn't unpleasant, the texture leaves a lot to be desired. It's both fibrous and greasy, with globs/pockets of fat and strings of what I can only imagine to be muscle or gristle of some kind. They're like white threads, and the mouthfeel of the sliced product is very unappetizing.<br /><br />In reading through the reviews again, I saw one where the reviewer mentioned this summer sausage had potential when heated/cooked, so I sliced it thinly and tried both panfrying and microwaving it. This does improve the texture and allows the extra fat to render out (if you're microwaving, be sure to sit the pieces on top of paper towels, and don't let it go too long without checking ... LOTS of fat drains out of the meat!). After it's been heated/cooked, the product can be enjoyed for its flavor without the unpleasant texture.<br /><br />If our regular choice becomes unavailable again at some point, we'll just do without or look for something in a local grocery store.

The description mentioned this being a milder coffee, so I was pleased to have the opportunity to try it.<br /><br />I enjoy flavored coffees, although rarely vanilla. I usually find the vanilla to be so overpowering that it masks any taste of the coffee beneath. I was pleased to note that upon opening the bag, the vanilla smell was subtle and pleasant. So far so good. Even though I normally buy whole bean, this bag is pre-ground. I brewed it in my Bunn coffee maker, which is a drip brewer. The aroma while brewing was lovely!<br /><br />I would say that this is definitely a dark roast, although it is milder than regular Starbucks. There is still a certain degree of bitterness. The vanilla flavor is perfect - just the right amount. My husband said that adding (real) cream and a little sugar make his cup a real treat.<br /><br />This coffee would thrill regular Starbucks fans who enjoy vanilla. However, it is somewhat smoother and milder than regular Starbucks, so I think you could serve it to anyone and it would be enjoyable. (Please note, despite the vanilla flavor, it is definitely strong and has a serious caffeine punch.)',\n",

There's no difference between Omahas chicken breasts and regular chicken breasts I can buy in any grocery store Save a lot/Aldi included....for well over 1/2 the price of what they charge for these and for nearly quadruple the amount. So, why charge so much for these? I can get behind their steaks, even though they're overpriced too, and a few other Omaha products like the hot dogs and stuffed baked potatoes, but can't really get behind these chicken breasts. It's not like these are organic chicken breasts that have a decent size to them, which is what the price Omaha charges for them would suggest. These are as generic as generic gets. Would of been fine if 1 of their chicken breasts was the size of 2 of their chicken breasts. Instead it's like they got 1 large chicken breast and cut it it up to make 4 out of it. Luckily, I received these in a comped sampler. There's no reason whatsoever for anyone to buy just these chicken breasts through Omaha Steaks as Omaha gives you no reason to. Omaha really needs to make their portions bigger. People would be fine paying their prices if the portions were bigger...but half the things they sell the price to size ratio leaves you feeling ripped off. Not that I paid for these as like I said they were comped, but if I did no doubt I'd feel pretty ripped off. Change your mentality Omaha. Instead of less is more, think MORE is MORE.

The resulting gumbo tastes like the real thing from New Orleans. I have made both shrimp gumbo and chicken/sausage gumbo, and both come out great with the few additions I\\'ve mentioned. Some people also add a few chopped okra, but not me.<br /><br />HINT (shrimp gumbo): Add cooked shrimp AFTER the gumbo has finished simmering and just before serving.

Saves lots of time as well.<br /><br />I also like the \"base\" better than the \"mix\" since it allows you to add as much or as little rice as you like to the soup.

Looking at the packaging for Beneful, one gets the impression a serving of this stuff is the equivalent of a nice, fresh salad. That might be true if your idea of a salad is ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols, rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, sorbitol, tricalcium phosphate, water, animal digest, salt, phosphoric acid, potassium chloride, dicalcium phosphate, sorbic acid, and l-lysine monohydrochloride. After those 19 primary ingredients are thrown into the hopper, dried peas and carrots appear on the list. Hmmm.<br /><br />Packaged dog food is what it is - a cheap way to give your pets a reasonably well-balanced diet at a low cost in a convenient form.

I LOVE this product and the Colorado Spice Company, and props to Amazon for having it too!  I use the Ancho Chili Pepper for dry rubs, marinades, sauces - add a teaspoon or so to some Mayo (1/4 cup) and Pesto (1-2 tablespoons) for anything from potatoes to salmon - AMAZING!!  When I purchased the first container I thought to myself that I would die with it 1/2 full, but no way.  I add it to many soups, stews, and it's a must for chili.  I shared some with a couple of friends (refilled old empty spice jars and put on a new label).  I no longer purchase standard chili powder, I use CSC Ancho and Smoked Paprika instead.  I highly recommend their spices.  The quality is amazing, the value is excellent, and it keeps well.  I opened my second container before my first was completely empty and compared the aroma of my four year old container and there was no difference.  It was kept in a cool, dark pantry in it's original container and it did not lose any of its flavor.  I have tried and highly recommend Colorado Spice Company's Ancho Chili Pepper, Smoked Paprika, and the Tomato Powder.  I'm sure they are all amazing, but those are the only products I have tried thus far.\",\n",

I also don't think my house pets need them) Their major qualm was that there was no statement about whether the fish in the food contained ethoxyquin, which is apparently a bad thing.

All I see is the rumor mill which went crazy reporting the 70 dead dogs.\",\n",
       " \"Stopped the Hairballs During the hair shedding season, my long haired cat was getting hairballs twice a week.  I gave her Laxatone and hairball relief treats to help it stop.  I also brushed her daily.  These things helped a little, but the Royal Canin Hairball Food helped the most.  Now, she almost never gets hairballs, even if I don't brush her often.  What's more, she's a picky eater, and she loves this food.  If you are experiencing hairball problems with your cat, I'd recommend this as something to try.  It worked for us!\",\n",
       " 'I love Lea & Perrins Traditional Steak Sauce This is a wonderful sauce who\\'s value I would put at about the same value per-ounce as A1 Sauce. I would even pay a slight premium more if you love it as much as I do but not a huge premium.<br /><br />For burgers this is hands down my absolute favorite topping.  A properly seasoned beef-patty w/ lettuce, Swiss cheese and Lea&Perrins Traditional Steak Sauce make a perfect burger.  This sauce is has great tangy, well-seasoned, slightly spicy-sweet flavor that is very unique.  I recommend every one try it.  Right now, a few local restaurants around me have it on their tables.  If you see it in your area, you really should try it on anything beef. Also, you can substitute this for any A1 Sauce flavor to try it out.<br /><br />In my opinion, Lea&Perrins has a done a very poor job of marketing this wonderful product in the U.S., and are really short changing themselves and their Customers. Way too often, I ask for this sauce in a Restaurant or Grocer and they\\'ll say they have it. But, they are always thinking of the L&P Worcestershire Sauce and are always confused there could be anything else. L&P really could have named the product better too to make it very distinct from their truly \"traditional sauce\" which is, of course, \"Lea&Perrins Original Worcestershire Sauce\". Their Worcestershire is great in it\\'s own right, but these two sauces have very different flavor profiles.  This is the second time this product has become commonly available in the U.S. and I am really hoping they do a better job of getting the word out this time.<br /><br />I love this sauce and I\\'m sure you\\'ll at least like it a lot.  Try it and let me know what you think.  Thanks.',\n",

       " 'Explosive! Tea In case you have never brewed gunpowder or wonder why the name: This tea is very dry and the leaves are small and rolled tight. When the hot water hits the leaves, they \"explode\" - they swell to many times their original size. Thus, the name gunpowder refers more to the dry preparation technique of the leaves and the way they expand than it does to thy type of leaves or their taste. Warning, if you brew this tea (or any other gunpowder) use about 1/2 or 1/4 the amount that you would use with another tea. The tea is pretty bitter, a taste I like but it isn\\'t for everyone. Since I like the taste and the explosion means less tea is used (less expensive per pot), I rated it 5 stars.',\n",

       " 'The \"Yucks\" had it right! With all the bad reviews, I still wanted to see for myself if this product was in any way passable for a peanut butter replacement, having shed 170lbs with a bit more still to go, I\\'m constantly looking for ways to eat things I like with as little calories as possible. Well I loves me some peanut butter, but with my new healthy way of eating, it\\'s pretty much absent from my diet these days, even as a very rare treat. With that in mind, I figured what the heck, I\\'ll give this a shot. Boy should I have heeded all the other posters advice! I\\'m pretty open minded about alternative or food substitutes, but this stuff, well \"YUCK\" is the word!<br />When I got it, along with several other Walden products I ordered from their site, it was the first thing I wanted to try. When I opened the jar it did have the look of PB so I was hopeful, maybe this WOULD be okay. It wasn\\'t. The first taste was sickeningly sweet, almost didn\\'t go back for a second one, but had to to see if what I tasted was right. Next bite was like an entirely different product. This time there wasn\\'t a super sweet taste, more like metallic or something. After that I thought \"oh boy\" I think I just blew nearly $50 bucks on this stuff (all the Walden products I had ordered). In fairness I did try pairing it up with other things, since I\\'d read on here that others advise not eating it on it\\'s own. So at first I tried a PB&J. It was just as bad. I tried with fruit. I tried mixing it with PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter and Powdered Cocoa Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 6.5 Oz Each - 2 Pack as someone else here suggested (which btw is a peanut butter replacement I do highly recommend). I tried it after I chilled it in the fridge and heated up in the microwave. I kept waiting for any semblance of a peanut flavor, but it never came. And so rather than leave it sitting in my fridge for the next several months, which it would have been as it was never going to get used, I threw it away. It wasn\\'t easy, firstly there was all the money I spent because I not only threw out the Peanut spread, I also tossed the grape and raspberry jams I couldn\\'t stand either. But it was also that I WANTED to have liked this enough to eat it.<br /><br />I will say out of the products I\\'ve sampled so far from Walden, I have yet to try the mayo, ketchup, and bacon ranch dressings I bought, I found at least some of them were okay. I\\'d say the best so far is the chocolate dip. It\\'s nothing like the consistency of melted chocolate, more like a chocolate pudding. But at least it was edible. The French onion dip wasn\\'t too bad either. Thousand Island dressing wasn\\'t all that great, but I\\'ll at least finish the bottle. I also don\\'t really care for the caramel sauce which I did have higher hopes for after the reviews it got.<br /><br />Again, I spent quite a bit on this, and it was pretty much money wasted, as I didn\\'t discover a great new product and won\\'t be buying any of this stuff again. But it hasn\\'t soured me on still trying low calorie alternatives to broaden my diet. I just will probably steer clear of the fake foods, since with tastes like this, the best way to have zero calories in your foods, is to just not have them.',\n",

I have eaten many \"healthy\" bars, some have been great and some terrible.<br />Before I purchase health-claiming-filled bars, I evaluate the following<br />contents: calories, fat, carbohydrates, and sugar. I also aim for whole<br />grain and avoid high fructose corn syrup at all costs. If anyone is into<br />healthy eating, I am sure everything I have mentioned sounds familiar.<br />Taking all my inspections into consideration, this bar exceeded my<br />expectations.

I prefer more protein in<br />my bars, but with all else included in this bar, 4g is good enough for me.<br /><br />Also, I just don\\'t see how flavor can go wrong with the combination this bar<br />offers: dark cherry and cocoa. As for the texture of the bar, however,<br />that\\'s where some consumers might be picky; the bar is, after all, slightly<br />dry, but not so dry as to make chewing unpleasant. Consider a semi-moist<br />cookie for texture. There\\'s a level of texture one desires in a chewy<br />chocolate chip cookie. Comparing to a cookie, this bar\\'s texture is below<br />that craving; it is still tasty nonetheless. My five year old enjoyed the<br />bar so much, he begged me not to take all of the bars to work (for my<br />snack), because he wanted to keep a few bars at home for when he craved<br />eating one.<br /><br />Overall, I (and my family) loved this bar.

The noodles are rice noodles and plentiful in this cup of soup.<br /><br />Good things about this cup of soup:<br /><br />-The portion is a good size; I would estimate 14-16 ounces prepared?<br /><br />-The flavor packet comes separate, so that the powder does not congeal or settle to the bottom of the cup in a concrete-like mass.  I remember this being a problem back in the 90's with healthy soup cup varieties.<br /><br />-The sodium count is 14% which is fairly low.<br /><br />-The whole cup of soup has 180 calories.<br /><br />Great portability, easy prep.

At first, I was not to thrilled to learn that the treat was raw tripe! Bacteria came to mind, and I was grossed out. Our trainer reassured me  it was safe for dogs and explained all the health benefits. I was reluctant to pay so much for a dog treat (retails $12.95 on Dr. Harvey's website to $19.99 at Unleashed by Petco), but after considering the benefits, my puppy's delight for the treat and trainer recommendation, I purchased it for my dog.<br /><br />The product comes in a resealable bag. The 3oz bag lasted me 2 months. I used it specifically for his weekly training (1 power patty/week). If you have a small dog, I recommend breaking the power patty into little pieces. Yes, it smells, but it's not that bad. Your dog will love the smell!<br /><br />I think it's too early to say if the product lives up to it's health claims.

One of the amazing things about human physiology is that our stomachs are designed to successfully hold that caustic solution.  Our esophagus is not, and when the sphincter between the stomach and throat is weak - even momentarily - the stomach acid splashes up into our esophagus and causes the familiar \"heartburn.\"<br />Methylxanthines are common substances that will relax the sphincters in our body, and they\\'re found in high quantities in caffeine and chocolates, for example.  So - how useful is a \"low acid coffee\" in preventing the actual cause of heartburn if it has the desirable caffeine?<br /><br />I wrote the Puroast people and pointed out these things and they wrote me back with links to research done by biochemists on coffees.  I was still scratching my head over what to write in my review when I got an email from the CEO of Puroast! Yeah, I was surprised!  Anyway, he wrote:<br /><br /> \"Puroast does not make a claim as to the correlation between the pH<br />of its coffee and the causes of heartburn/reflux, only that the coffee has<br />significantly lower acid content (up to 80% lower) than leading commercial<br />brands.\"<br /><br />So - \"Puroast Low Acid Coffee offers consumers who a great tasting, smooth coffee that is proven to give symtpom (sic) relief to consumers who suffer from heartburn, reflux, and other related conditions.\" - isn\\'t a claim that there is a correlation between the ph of its coffee and the causes of heartburn?  Am I being trivial to point out that their product description misspells \"symptom\" and that the package I received misspelled \"gourmet?\")<br /><br />So - is it good coffee?  It ain\\'t bad.

Organic, cheaper price, larger quantity, and positive reviews all seemed to indicate that it was a smart purchase.<br /><br />PACKAGING:  There\\'s been some discussion as to the packaging of the SerendipiTea\\'s matcha.  Inside a thin cardboard box is a heavy paper bag with the top rolled up.  Inside the bag is a thin foil bag containing the tea.  The box and paper bag are decent, but the foil used is extremely thin, and mine had several holes and tears that allowed a powdery dust to accumulate.<br /><br />TEA:  There\\'s definitely a difference in color compared to the DoMatcha tea.  While DoMatcha was a bright, vibrant green, SerendipiTea resembled olive drab and looked sickly in comparison.  It tastes far more bitter compared to DoMatcha\\'s smooth flavor...I kind of had to choke down the rest of my cup.<br /><br />On the bottom of the box it notes that this is CULINARY grade tea, not ceremonial grade.  I do not know if this accounts for the difference in color vibrancy and flavor, but I\\'m willing to bet it might.<br /><br />If you\\'re planning on cooking with matcha or making ice cream/smoothies then SerendipiTea\\'s matcha provides more bang for your buck.  However, if you\\'re simply looking for a tasty brewed cup this might not be the most delicious option.  While DoMatcha was definitely more expensive, I think I\\'d prefer to pay the extra to get the quality and taste that\\'s best for me, and in the meantime I\\'m off to find some good matcha recipes to use up the rest of my SeredipiTea!',\n",

Both of my dogs have really bad dental issues- I brush them every day but I also give them a dental bone every day. The Nutri Dents has gone in their regular rotation. My dogs are pretty small- Romeo is about 11 pounds and Juliet is roughly 9 pounds. They used to be given the small or mini versions of these treats, but because they are pretty aggressive chewers I give them the medium sized ones now- after some trial and error. These treats aren't super soft- but they are relatively soft when compared to other dental treats we have tried. These have a really similar texture to the Greenies brand, but we like these ones much better than the Greenies. This flavor smells pretty gross to me, but my pups love them. I like the smell of the Extra Fresh flavored ones- they really smell like parsley and eucalyptus oil, which both can be found on the ingredient list of that flavor. I like that these are gluten free. I like that they have added vitamins and omegas. These ones are okay as a treat and the chewing action is always good, but I like that the other flavor has actual ingredients that are good for dental health. Most importantly, my dogs love the taste of both of the treats. I buy these ones rarely, as I much prefer the other ones, but these are still good treats. The only negatives I have are that these are relatively pricey, and they are devoured quite quickly, even by my dogs who are 12 years old and missing nearly half of their teeth. They are still much better than many other treat brands out there and I do recommend them.\",\n",

       " 'Slight unpleasant chemical aftertaste In the old days, water was water. Now days, consumers have their choice of bottled or tap, sparkling or flat, distilled or spring, and a hundred other options too complex for most to care about. In this case, Essentia is marketed as pH balanced at 9.5, meaning it is significantly alkaline (basic in the old parlance - the opposite of acidic) compared to traditional water, which falls roughly around 7 pH (give or take). Various websites will extol the virtues of this sort of waters, while others call it bunk. To me, however, all that matters is the flavor.<br /><br />Essentia water lives up to its label - it does have a silky smooth taste (or lack thereof). The problem is, it also has a slight chemical aftertaste that is most likely due to the added sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride. I also experienced a mild dry mouth after drinking it which I attribute to drinking an alkaline substance in a mouth that generally runs either very slightly acidic or very slightly basic. These aspects are enough for me not to drink it anymore, though I have had significantly worse-tasting water.<br /><br />Rating: 2 out of 5 stars. The mild chemical aftertaste is too much for me, but it still tastes better than Dasani.',\n",

Like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies, I popped one in my mouth, with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what I expected to be the awful (to me) flavor. I was shocked to find I not only didn't object to these, but became hooked on them in short order.<br /><br />I have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co-worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on Amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store.

Since we can not insure that the beef or chickens used in dog food are of the same quality as what we eat, salmon and potatoes are a better choice. Our female has lost 5 pounds from a hefty 40 lbs to 35lbs and has leveled out beautifully. The male has lost 8 pounds and has also leveled out to the vets praise. She was impressed with their progress at 9 years old. My geriatric children love the taste and no longer hesitate around the food bowl. The internet is a wonderful thing and I am so glad we found Premium Edge. It is a high quality dry dog food that is reasonably priced. You can pay more, but you return on investment will be marginal.

It is definitely low sodium and if you have a medical condition that requires very low sodium,  this soup would fit the bill.

I personally feel that most of our food has way too much salt and sugar in it so I thought I would give this product a try.

I think that soup, generally, needs salt but as I stated, most are much too salty, however, this soup is just too bland.  When I added a little bit of salt, that made a big difference.  Also, I noticed that the soup is very watery and thin.  I like my mushroom soup a little more substantial.  I do think this soup would work very well in casserole recipes.  I probably will not purhase the low sodium variety of Campbell's Mushroom Soup but I do like many of their other products.  However, and this is important, if it is an absolute necessity that you cut back on salt for health reason, then this soup would be perfect for you. Some non-salt seasoning could make it more flavorful.  I give Campbell's credit for trying to make their products more health conscious.  More companies should do the same.

The bagsv are big and sometimes I only need to eat half to feel satisfied, honestly. (Not like the PopC**ps where I can eat a whole ig bag) Wish I could get them in stores. They grow on you and for me they were worth the money to stay on my diet.\",\n",

My stomach was starting to grumble and I had some extremely painful hunger pains starting. After I took the sample I headed to the check out and finished my shopping trip. By the time I got home the hunger was gone. I had forgotten all about it. In fact it was so effective, nothing sounded good and I had to force myself to eat something. That level of hunger and craving control lasted all day. I had great energy and my mood seemed lifted. Needless to say I went back before they closed and bought a bottle. So far, this stuff is awesome and I'll continue to use it as long as it works. I have been battling the last 10-15 pounds for years! All because I have uncontrollable cravings. I work out and they get even worse. This is my answer :)\",\n",

I suspect the DNS is in reference to the Potassium Bicarbonate (fizz-producer?) that lurks within the ingredients. There WAS a nice little \"kick\" to this -- perhaps from the Potassium Bicarbonate.<br /><br />The initial taste produced an \"aaah!\" reaction. This is a nice full-bodied coffee, straight from the can, or iced (if consumed shortly after being iced). As a coffee purist who grew up with my Italian Nonna and her old-fashioned espresso pots, it would have been anathema for me to put this in a cup and Nuke it. But I suspect the flavor would not be diminished by doing so.<br /><br />Is this a real Espresso experience? The name says it all - \"Italian espresso STYLE Coffee drink\".

The taste and texture of this nut bar is the exact same taste as the beloved \"no bake fruit cake\" that my Nana made us when I was a little girl back in the 50s and 60s. It must be the dates and the particular kind of nuts because it tickles my taste buds in just such a way as to send me back years ago. I thank you Kind bar makers as being genius in your combinations of ingredients. I love these things... Love, love, love. I have just recently made an order with Amazon for a box of 12 of these things... and just when I remembered a book I wanted and decided to add that to my order... gosh, well, I goofed up and I hope that Amazon figures it out for me just in time because if I get all 24 of these nut bars I am in real trouble. I will eat them till they\\'re gone. So, please, cross my fingers Amazon does their usual magic and gets my order just right! I have been invited to \"Like\" them on my Facebook page, but then I don\\'t go there often and... well, if I tell everyone, then they may become hard to find in the future... sorta like telling everyone where your favorite fishing hole is and then not being able to go there because it\\'s so crowded.<br /><br />Computers are so picky!  I offered to write a review of a different flavor of this Kind bar and it told me that only one review per product per customer... but I could edit my review! So, here I am. Back again to further praise and describe what has become my favorite snack food.

Besides topping this on popcorn, which was perfect for all the popcorn my co-worker received, you can sprinkle this on many other food items. Since I can\\'t eat popcorn anymore because of TMJ/jaw problems, I sprinkle this on pasta dishes, baked potatoes, mashed potatoes, soups, eggs, soft bread, etc. The cheese topping tastes great, and adds some flavor to your food.

He pointed out that brewing PG Tips too long would result in a bitter brew. His technique, which I follow, is to brew the loose tea, after warming the pot, for two minutes then immediately pouring up into cups. I like mine with a nice bit of milk but no sugar.<br /><br />I had great difficulty getting a good brew until I was given a 2-cup, Brown Betty. I initially used my father\\'s tea pot in which he brewed Lipton\\'s every after noon. It was too big (4 or 5 cup) and had the spout with pierced plug at its base which made it difficult to clean. Then I bought a tea pot and cup set put out by one of the greeting card companies. It was very cute and, hence, did not have the optimum shape to make good tea easily. It was a little smaller than my father\\'s pot and the spout was clear. The spout did not rise as high as the lid so I had trouble keeping it from spilling before I could get it aimed at the cup. The two cup Brown Betty solved these difficulties.<br /><br />As to timing the brew, I at first attempted to keep my eye on the clock with a sweep second hand. I would get busy and miss the two minute point. I got a wind-up kitchen timer with a very loud bell. I warm the pot, put in one level tablespoon of tea, add 15 oz just boiled fresh filtered well water, put on the lid and cozy, then set the timer. When the bell sounds, I remove the cozy, place the strainer on my 16 oz travel mug, and carefully pour up the brew. Success every time! I add a couple of ounces of whole milk and enjoy my afternoon tea.',\n",

I was a bit suspect about a thin, crunchy cookie under the Newton name, but I have to admit the cookie is good.  It has a nice crunch and a balanced sweetness.  Three nice-sized cookies are only 140 calories, which is another pleasant surprise.  My only complaint is that the cookie leaves a bit of a chalky feeling in my mouth after eating it.  I can't say this will topple the original Fig Newton from its perch near the top of the cookie world, but it is a nice complement to the product line.\",\n",

       " \"Disappointed Please don't let my title fool you....my plant grew perfectly and the color on my peppers are a bright orange. I'll get to why i'm disappointed later.<br /><br />1. As a previous reviewer wrote you have to plant these in late spring. Follow the instructions with the can and it will be fine.  I kept it in the can until it actually grew over 4 stems. Getting it out of the can witout destroying the root was not easy in anyway.<br /><br />2. Plant in a large pot. My plant was on my balcony with FULL SUN and i watered it everyday.  I used Mircale Grow Soil with food. As the plant continued to grow i added used EGG Shells to the soil. I continued to water it when the soil got dry as it got bigger. I wish i could add a picture of my peppers but i don't feel like adding a video review. The color is beautiful<br /><br />3. Full SUN all the time.<br /><br />4. Pull the plant back inside if the weather drops below 50.<br /><br />the reason why i am disappointed. It wasn't as intense as i thought it would be. I guess i built up the pain index thinking it was going to be insane heat requiring gallons of milk to be spread on my face. I thought of Homer Simpson and Guatemalan Insanity Pepper....but it didn't happen that way. I did eat it raw...don't know if that had anything to do with it.<br /><br />Plant rocks...don't be fooled. People may have gotten bad plants. I was scared when i first got it because i thought it was a dud. Give it time, water & sun (basic plant stuff) and it will grow painfully slow.\",\n",
       " \"Most delicious coconut water I've tasted, but most cans dented My husband and I love coconut water and our go-to brand has been Vita Coco; however, I received a listing of various coconut waters from Amazon based on my purchasing and browsing history and decided to try Taste Nirvana with pulp. I am glad that I did because this is truly the tastiest coconut water I've consumed thus far. There were some complaints that there are hard chunks of coconut in there, rather than silky bits. I have encountered both very silky bits of coconut and more al dente pieces. I must say that I actually appreciate this variation. I enjoy chewing the chewier bits and don't care if they come from older coconuts as some critics have said, and, of course, the silky pieces are a little bit of heaven. The coconut water itself is nice and sweet and I find it a refreshing way to start my day, often enjoying a can on my way to work. I figure this is also a good way to restore some electrolytes in the morning. Another benefit is that the huge can only costs me 2 Weight Watchers Points on the Points Plus system. Of course, consumers watching their sugar levels should note that coconut water is high in natural sugars, so it should be used in moderation only, especially because drinking large amounts can also cause unwanted gastrointestinal issues.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about the coconut water has nothing to do with the water itself, but the cans. Several of my cans were dented, and I do not believe this occurred during shipping. They were shrink wrapped nice and snug in a box and had much padding, yet the cans were dented in strange places. There are some concerns that dented cans can pose a health risk, enabling bacteria to enter the product. However, I have used even the dented cans and have not had any ill effects from this, as far as I can tell, but would obviously prefer receiving undamaged cans on subsequent orders so as not to incur such a potential risk. Because of the cans being dented, I knocked off one star.\",\n",
       " 'did not work for me unfortunately I am very surprised that I felt the way I did after trying one of these 5 hour energy drinks.  I did not think there was that much caffeine in each one but apparently there is because I had the jitter attacks bi-time which started about ten minutes after I finished the bottle.  I got the sick feeling and it did not go away for, well about 5 hours actually.  I was very close to putting my finger down my throat to try to throw it up thinking maybe that would make me feel better, although I\\'m a pretty big wimp so I didn\\'t do that.<br /><br />I am not overly sensitive to caffeine but while the 5-hour energy drink obviously works for some people, it did not work for me.  I tried green tea capsules about a week later (yes I was on the hunt for a good energy booster) and I have not had one negative experience to report.  I also recommend raspberry ketones which I take with the green tea, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008HYRW6G\">Green Tea Extract 60 Capsules (500mg) + FREE 25 Grams Raspberry Ketones Powder</a>.  I think I found a good combination for me, finally.<br /><br />The only reason I need to take something for energy is because I start work at 5am everyday, which means I get up at 3:45am!  I try to stay away from coffee and based on my own experience and research green tea extract is the most natural and effective energy booster I know of that I can take without any side effects.

It resolved a diarrhea problem quickly-- we think one of the cats became allergic to something in that Fancy Feast.  They enjoy Wellness much more; they have never attacked any food or treat more voraciously, even real chicken.  Plus, the litter box does not smell as bad, and I feel better about giving them food without nasty byproducts.  This is described as human-quality food, though I haven't been brave enough to try, I believe it.  Instead of smelling like a bag of fast food that got stuck under the seat in my car for a month, this smells like chicken soup.<br /><br />We tried getting our boys onto Avoderm, which definitely made their coats shinier and softer, and even increased their activity level (hard to believe for these Bengals).  However, once the mix got to be over 50% Avoderm, they didn't like the taste.  Can't give a low rating to any cat food because of taste.<br /><br />One note about shipping-- the packaging has not been perfect, but it's not nearly as bad as some of the other reviewers say.  The second case I received had a few cans with minor dents, but nothing was leaking.  The shipping box is larger than the case, with air-filled plastic pillows to fill the voids.<br /><br />This is not the least expensive food out there, but you are getting a better product.  We think it is worth it.\",\n",

But, quite honestly, there really isn't much flavor in this caramel version.  It tasted more like regular coffee than anything else and for the price, I expected their usual great taste.  The vanilla biscotti is quite hard to beat so I thought this one would stand up close to that one.  Chocolate is quite good in the Folger's too so you might want to give that a try.  If you're a fan of flavored coffees, go ahead and try this with cream and sugar.  It might work for you, but if you're like me and prefer the more flavored versions, you'll have to add some of International's caramel-flavored creamer to get the full flavor of this version.\",\n",
